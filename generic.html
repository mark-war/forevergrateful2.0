								<p>One of the greatest misconceptions about forgiveness is the belief that it necessitates reconciliation. And that is precisely what I aim to address in this blog. Indeed, forgiveness is a daunting task. It challenges us to confront our deepest pains and wounds. Yet, through this journey, we can gain a profound understanding of forgiveness and its transformative power in our lives.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I found myself grappling with this very dilemma – how could I forgive when the pain still lingered? The scars on my heart remained unhealed, and the mere thought of forgiveness only seemed to exacerbate the pain. I convinced myself that distancing myself from the source of my anguish would bring me solace. But I was mistaken. The more I attempted to convince myself that I had moved on, the more profound the ache within me grew. I became irritable, short-tempered, and felt as though the world was against me. Unbeknownst to me, my bitterness affected not only myself but also those around me who genuinely cared. I inadvertently pushed away loved ones because of this misconception. Little did I realize, I wasn't suffering alone; my unforgiving heart was spreading misery to those in my orbit. Despite my efforts to conceal it, my inner turmoil eventually surfaced, tarnishing every word, action, and thought with resentment and anger. I was consumed by hatred, and my life spiraled into chaos.</p>

<p>But as fate would have it, divine intervention intervened. God has a way of unsettling us when we become too comfortable in discomfort. I stumbled upon a video on forgiveness (which I must've watched at least three to five times). Suddenly, clarity emerged, illuminating the path toward forgiveness. I sensed God's guiding hand leading me toward a new beginning – the path of forgiveness. He ushered me into a realm of inner peace, one that I had long yearned for.

<p>In this transformative process, I learned that forgiveness isn't merely a gift we bestow upon others; it's a gift we give ourselves first. As we cultivate forgiveness within ourselves, it inevitably overflows, touching the lives of those around us. Oftentimes, we hesitate to extend forgiveness, fearing it may make us appear weak. However, I soon realized it was quite the opposite. Holding onto grudges only weakens us, burdening our hearts with unnecessary weight. As one influential figure once said, "forgiveness is taking away the power from others to hurt you repeatedly." Upon deeper reflection, I found this statement to be profoundly true. The longer we harbor pain in our hearts, the more we subject ourselves to repeated suffering.</p>

<p>Forgiveness doesn't necessitate reconciliation; it doesn't entail returning to the way things once were. Contrary to popular belief, forgiveness isn't a two-way street; it's a solitary journey toward inner peace. It's a gift we bestow upon ourselves to liberate ourselves from pain, allowing the space once filled with bitterness and resentment to be filled with peace. Reflecting on my own journey, I've come to understand this perspective. Yet, the road to forgiveness is anything but easy. Despite my progress, I still grapple with fleeting moments of bitterness. However, I've learned to acknowledge these emotions without allowing them to consume me. Yes, my friend, harboring unforgiveness within us only inflicts further suffering than the initial hurt. And ultimately, we have the power to decide whether we allow it to hurt us or not.</p>

<p>I share my story with you today because I've learned these lessons the hard way. I've witnessed firsthand how unforgiveness can corrode relationships and dim the light within us. I've condemned myself and doubted my own prayers, all because I allowed unforgiveness to fester within me. Yet, through God's gentle guidance, I've learned to let go and surrender my pain to Him.</p>

<p>Forgiveness may seem daunting, especially in the immediate aftermath of pain – and that's perfectly okay. Allow yourself to feel the full spectrum of emotions, from anger to sadness, as you navigate through the pain. Trust that in due time, you'll know when you're ready to forgive. And when that moment arrives, embrace it with gratitude. For through forgiveness, we emerge as stronger, more compassionate beings. So let us affirm together, with unwavering conviction, "I will forgive because I am reclaiming power over my own happiness…and today, I choose peace!"</p>

<p>Be blessed!</p>
